# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project-Harnoor Rangi

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.
The R script, `run_analysis.R`, does the following:

1. Download the dataset and unzip it in the working directory
2. Load the necessary libraries
3. Merge the training and test sets to create one data set 
4. Extract the measurements of the mean and standard deviation of each measurement.
5. Use descriptive names to name the activities in the dataset. 
6. Create a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each
   variable for each subject and activity pair.

The end result is shown in the file `tidy.txt`.
